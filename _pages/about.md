## 🚀 Intro 

I am a passionate innovator at the intersection of Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and the scientific domains of Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics. As a CTO of [Deep MedChem](deepmedchem.com), I lead efforts to increase efficiency of insilico drug discovery.

## 🌟 Recent Projects

* [Explorer of Chemical Spaces](https://explorer.deepmedchem.com/) – An Interactive Visualisation of 11+ Public Chemical Spaces
* [Chemical Embeddings Search Engine](https://cheese.deepmedchem.com/) – Billion Scale Vector Database for Chemical Similarity Search including 3D Shape and Electrostatics
* [ESP and RESP partial charges](https://electrostatics.deepmedchem.com/) – DFT-quality ESP and RESP partial charges for free in a streamlit app
